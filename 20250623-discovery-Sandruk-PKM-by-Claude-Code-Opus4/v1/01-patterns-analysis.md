# Sandruk's Patterns Analysis
*Discovery by Claude Code Opus4 - 2025-06-23*

## Core Identity Patterns

### 1. The HyperSystem Pattern
You simultaneously create entropy AND hyper-organization. This isn't a bug - it's your operating system:
- **Symptom**: 3000+ files in codebase, 516+ line .zshrc
- **Manifestation**: Complex folder structures with symlinks everywhere
- **Real Need**: Systems that embrace complexity rather than fight it

### 2. The Drowning Pattern (Drown-pattern-sink)
Not just overthinking - you're drowning in your own solutions:
- Create system → System becomes too complex → Create meta-system → Repeat
- Each solution spawns 3 new problems
- The tools meant to help become additional cognitive load

### 3. Executive Dysfunction Compensation
Your entire PKM is a monument to compensating for executive dysfunction:
- Time tracking to the minute (because time blindness)
- Multiple entry points to same data (object permanence issues)
- Voice-first approach (lowest friction input)
- Git commits as external memory

### 4. RSD (Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria)
From your own notes: "интенсивная эмоциональная боль в ответ на воспринимаемое неодобрение"
- Argumentative looping with Dima
- Sunk cost fallacy in discussions
- Need to "дожать" every argument

### 5. Context Switching as Survival
Not a bug but a feature of your brain:
- Multiple projects running in parallel
- Each with its own daily log
- Prompt/Output pattern for preserving context
- Frustration when tools don't preserve YOUR context

## Work Patterns

### Leadership Paradox
- 60-75% time spent on team management
- Helping others while your own systems crumble
- Classic ADHD manager pattern: external structure for others, internal chaos

### Tool Proliferation
- VSCode + Cursor + Claude Desktop + multiple MCP configs
- Each tool solving one problem, creating three more
- Configuration complexity becoming its own project

### Documentation Obsession
- Writing cheatsheets you'll forget exist
- Creating sync scripts for duplications
- SSOT principle fighting with need for redundancy
- "grep" для поиска того, что сам же написал

## Physical Manifestations
- 50% body battery recovery
- Nausea from cognitive overload
- "Гвозди в голове" - unfinished tasks as physical pain
- Early morning sessions when brain is freshest

## What Actually Works

### 1. Visual Organization
- Heavy emoji use for categorization
- Clear section dividers
- Color-coded time blocks
- Checklists everywhere

### 2. Atomic Patterns
- Small, self-contained notes
- Multiple linking strategies
- Symlinks as breadcrumbs

### 3. Voice-First Input
- Lowest friction capture
- SuperWhisper integration
- Transcriptions as primary input

### 4. Time Anchoring
- Precise timestamps everywhere
- Toggl integration
- Daily/weekly/monthly rollups

## The Real Problem

You don't need another system. You need:
1. **Persistent Context** - AI that remembers across sessions
2. **Autonomous Execution** - Works without supervision
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Understands YOUR patterns, not textbook ADHD
4. **Forgiveness Architecture** - Systems that work even when you forget they exist

## Key Insight

Your "problems" are actually features:
- Hyperfocus → Deep work capability
- System building → Architecture thinking
- Pattern recognition → Complex problem solving
- Time blindness → Flow state access

The issue isn't changing these patterns - it's building systems that work WITH them instead of against them.
