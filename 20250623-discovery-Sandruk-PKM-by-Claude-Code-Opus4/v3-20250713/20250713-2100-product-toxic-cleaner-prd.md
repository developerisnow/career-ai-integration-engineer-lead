## 🎨 Product Vision

**Tagline:** "Stop energy vampires. Focus on real friends. Achieve your goals."

**Problem:** You have 1000+ contacts but can't distinguish supporters from energy drainers. Toxic people block your growth while real allies get forgotten.

**Solution:** AI that analyzes ALL your communications to identify:
- 🧛 Energy vampires who only take
- 💎 Hidden gems who genuinely support you
- ⚠️ Red flag patterns before they hurt you
- 🌟 People worth investing time in

| Takes without giving | 🔴 +30 | "Помог с таблетками → атака про развод" |
| Uses personal against you | 🔴 +50 | "Знал про развод → использовал как оружие" |
| Ignores boundaries | 🔴 +20 | "Злится когда ставишь границы" |
| Energy drain pattern | 🔴 +25 | "После общения нужен день восстановления" |
| Gaslighting language | 🔴 +40 | "Ты слишком чувствительный" |

### 2. Support Pattern Recognition

| Pattern | Green Flag Score | Example |
|---------|------------------|---------|

```

### 4. The "Next Level" Categorization

Based on the book + toxicity layer:

| Category | Healthy | Toxic |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Тыл** (Rear guard) | Unconditional support | Emotional manipulation |
| **Соратники** (Peers) | Mutual growth | Competition/jealousy |
| **Последователи** (Followers) | Learn and contribute | Only take knowledge |
| **Наставники** (Mentors) | Guide without agenda | Control/superiority |

"You haven't talked to these supportive people in 6+ months:"
- Dima Tsimbalyuk - helped in crisis, never asked return
- Anton Karakursakh - consistent positive interactions
- Vitaly Litvinchuk - understands your challenges

### 6. Real-time Alerts
