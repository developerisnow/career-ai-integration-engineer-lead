# 🔍 GAP ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS

## Identified Gaps

### 1. Enterprise Scale Stories
**Gap:** Limited Fortune 500 experience
**Impact:** May limit appeal for enterprise roles
**Recommendation:** Emphasize scale achieved at startup (300K LOC, 100K users)

### 2. Budget Management
**Gap:** No explicit P&L responsibility stories
**Impact:** Senior management positions may question financial acumen
**Recommendation:** Add financial impact to existing stories (e.g., $500K saved)

### 3. Conflict Resolution
**Gap:** No direct conflict/difficult conversation stories
**Impact:** Leadership roles need this competency
**Recommendation:** Develop story from blockchain pivot resistance

### 4. Data/ML Engineering
**Gap:** AI integration focus, less on ML model development
**Impact:** Pure ML roles might find experience light
**Recommendation:** Emphasize AI architecture and integration expertise

### 5. Security/Compliance
**Gap:** Limited security-focused stories
**Impact:** Enterprise roles often require this
**Recommendation:** Add security considerations to infrastructure stories
