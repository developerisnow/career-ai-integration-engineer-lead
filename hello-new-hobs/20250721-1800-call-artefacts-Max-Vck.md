SOFTSWISS

Security · Warszawa, Poland · Fully Remote
Head of SOC

Apply for this job
Overview:
SOFTSWISS continues to expand the team and is looking for a Head of SOC. We need a true, experienced, and accomplished professional who shares our culture and values. 

We’re looking for someone who lives and breathes security - not just to manage a SOC, but to shape how the entire company detects, responds to, and learns from threats.

Security Team:
SOFTSWISS Security Team takes care of iGaming services protection, data privacy, and business continuity to ensure that nothing distracts satisfied customers from using our products. We work closely with the IT team that develops and supports our services, and together we create genuinely excellent and secure iGaming products.

Purpose of the Role:
You’ll lead our security response from the front line: coordinating technical and business teams when things break, guiding investigations, and making sure we come out of every incident smarter and stronger.

Key responsibilities:
Being the decision-maker during security incidents: from first detection to root cause fix, recovery, and postmortem
Lead and grow a tight-knit SOC team, supporting their development and keeping them ahead of the game
Build and evolve our incident response processes, with a strong focus on automation and real-time visibility
Run investigations, coordinate across teams, and make sure we don’t just patch symptoms but fix real issues
Strengthen our Threat Intelligence capabilities and proactively shape defences before attackers knock
Requirements:
5+ years in Security Operations or Incident Response - you’ve seen enough to stay calm under pressure
Deep understanding of attacker behaviour (MITRE ATT&CK should feel like second nature)
Experience with digital forensics and open-source tools (FTK, R-Studio, or whatever works best)
Proven experience building and tuning SIEM systems and implementing SOAR/IRP solutions to enhance detection and response
Comfortable navigating cloud security: telemetry, investigation, and attack paths across modern stacks
Nice to have:
Experience with Red/ Blue team exercises
What we offer:
Full-time remote work opportunities and flexible working hours
Comprehensive Mental Health Programme
Private insurance
Sports program compensation
Free online English lessons
An additional 1 Day off per calendar year
Generous referral program
Training, internal workshops, and participation in international professional conferences and corporate events
