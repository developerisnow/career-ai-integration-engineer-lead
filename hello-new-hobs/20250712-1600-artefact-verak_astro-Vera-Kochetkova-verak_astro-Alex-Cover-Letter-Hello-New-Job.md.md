# cover letter

Hello, Nove Nordics team\!  
I’m Vera Kochetkova and I’m a Data Scientist with 5 years of experience in different domains, including NLP, Recommender Systems and Computer Vision.

Here are the 4 main reasons why I should be considered for the role of Senior Data Scientist:

- I have a strong foundation in Python and have successfully collaborated with cross-functional teams delivering 5 scalable machine learning solutions to production.  
- I developed through the whole lifecycle AI service for biologists with 350GB of scientific articles, RAG application and Azure Cloud deployment, accelerating scientific research workflows from several days to up to 3 hours.  
- I reduced transcription hallucinations by 80% in audio segments by fine-tuning OpenAI Whisper on challenging samples, significantly improving the reliability of speech recognition for video content.  
- Optimised embedding process by deploying parallel pipelines across 3 Azure regions, resulting in a 3x increase in process speed and significantly enhancing operational efficiency and scalability.

Novo Nordisk's mission to defeat serious chronic diseases resonates with my passion for life sciences and sustainability. I am eager to bring my expertise in data science to your Data & Modelling department, contributing to innovative AI solutions that drive real-world progress in health and knowledge discovery.

I would love to talk more about this opportunity and answer any questions.

Best wishes,  
Vera Kochetkova
