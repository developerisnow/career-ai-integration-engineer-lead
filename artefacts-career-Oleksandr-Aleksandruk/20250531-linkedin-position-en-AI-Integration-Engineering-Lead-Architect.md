## **About**

Hi\! I'm Alex, a technical leader and architect with 10+ years of experience in software development and a deep specialization in integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into complex production systems. My passion is transforming AI's potential into real, measurable results for businesses and development teams.  
**My current mission:** Leading the integration of AI tools and the creation of AI agents into a large-scale (300K+ lines of code) SaaS platform built with TypeScript, NestJS, using DDD, CQRS, and a microservices architecture. **The results speak for themselves:**

* 🚀 **Increased feature development velocity by 40%+**  
* ✅ **Maintained test coverage at 98%+**  
* ⚙️ **Full adoption of AI assistants by a team of 5 engineers**  
* 🛡️ **Zero production incidents related to AI-generated code**

I'm not just a theorist – I'm a practitioner, working "in the trenches" daily, solving real-world challenges of AI integration in both legacy systems and new projects. My approach combines deep technical understanding (from architecture to code) with experience in team management and building efficient development processes.  
**Key areas of expertise:**

* **AI Integration & Solution Architecture:** Designing and implementing AI solutions (LLMs, RAG, AI Agents) in existing and new systems.  
* **AI-Powered Backend Development:** Experience developing in TypeScript (NestJS, Node.js), Python, Go with active application of AI tools (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot).  
* **Legacy System Modernization with AI:** Strategies and tactics for safely introducing AI into large, established codebases.  
* **Developer Experience (DX) & DevRel:** Creating AI tools and processes that improve developers' lives. Founded and grew several technical communities (Web3, AI/LLMs) with hundreds of active members.  
* **Technical Leadership & Mentoring:** Experience in managing teams, building R\&D processes, and driving innovation.

I believe AI is not a replacement for engineers, but a powerful amplifier of their capabilities. My goal is to help companies and teams leverage this potential to 100%, creating products faster, with higher quality, and more enjoyably.  
I'm looking for an opportunity to apply my unique experience at the intersection of AI, Software Architecture, and Engineering Leadership to solve ambitious challenges. Open to discussing roles at the Lead/Principal Engineer, AI Solution Architect, AI Engineering Manager, or Technical Program Manager (AI Transformation) level.  
Let's connect and discuss how we can build the future of software development together\!
