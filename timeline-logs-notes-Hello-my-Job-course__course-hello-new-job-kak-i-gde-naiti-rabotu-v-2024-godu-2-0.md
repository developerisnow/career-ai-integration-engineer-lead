                - [x] analyse how hidden folder of cursor works with Perplexity research `I have used before Inteleji Idea IDE for coding and it usually uses system hidden folder inside opened project '.idea' to indexing files and so on. But now I moved to AI IDE fork of Visual Studio Code named 'Cursor.com' and it has different way of indexing. I've noticed on my macos /Users/user folder multiple .hidden folders named for e.g. '.cursor-tutor-18' and so on. But it not like my project-folder-code named. And I want to learn and understand how it works for remove 1 of 30 folders which has bugs. When I open in a cursor specific folder a windows with it unexpectly closed after few minutes, my fix idea is to just remove hidden indexing folder and open again and it will probably will be fixed.
